# vatlayer JSON API

[Vatlayer](https://vatlayer.com) is a free, simple JSON-based REST API allowing you to validate VAT numbers, retrieve all or single EU VAT rates based on IP address or country code, convert prices in compliance with EU VAT rates and types, and more.

API results are requested using a transparent and easy-to-understand URL structure and delivered in handy JSON format, making for the highest possible level of compatibility with any of your applications, programming languages and frameworks.

## Data Sources

In order to achieve a high standard of data accuracy and response speed for every API request, the vatlayer API relies on multiple servers and a distinct "fallback & validation" mechanism, consisting of a fairly large number of different data sources (instances), which include the European Commission's databases. 

If one instance fails to deliver an accurate data response (which does not even occur in 99.9% of the cases), the next highest one is assigned with the respective request. Only this way can we provide a consistent service and API living up to our customer's expectations.
